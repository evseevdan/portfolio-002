	<h1><u>About</u></h1>
		<p>This program is object-oriented and simulates one round of a popular Russian card game, which consists of 8 tricks, or sub-rounds.
	<h2>Methodology</h2>
		<p>It uses object-oriented programming to simulate a card game by using objects and classes to perform the various actions required to run a card game.
	<h2>Shortfalls</h2>
		<p>The game implemented is a simplified version of the true game of King. For example, the game usually has many rounds, such as counting Jacks and Kings, or Queens, or Hearts, or only the King of Hearts (which is the original namesake of the game, even though many people don't play that round). However, these can vary greatly by region. Also, there is frequently a minus/plus mechanic, where during the first half of the game, negative points are awarded for "winning", but during the second half, actual points are awarded.
		<p>There are some points in the program where similar or exactly identical code was repeated. This is not ideal in programming, as if the code of interest requires changing, one of the instances can be missed, leading to unexpected results.
